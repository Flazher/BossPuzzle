Q: The hell is this?
===================

A: This is just curses powered Boss puzzle organized in client-server model.
Yes, that's kind of weird.

Q: Client-server? For God's sake, why?
====================

A: Because I can, that's why. Don't ask stupid questions.

Q: Anyway, it's just a puzzle. Why do I need client-server model?
======================================================

Actually, you don't. But that's me.
Server generates a game field and handles client's request.
The task of client side is just draw the field.

Q: You're such an idiot.
======================

A: I know.
